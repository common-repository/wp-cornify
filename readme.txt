A simple plugin to activate an easter egg such as Cornify in your WordPress site when one enters the "Konami code"

== Description ==

This plugin uses [sample jQuery code published by Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/2009/cornify-easter-egg-with-jquery/)
to enable an easter egg in your WordPress site (such as Cornify) when a visitor enters the "Konami code". For those of you that 
are not gamers  or ARE gamers but have been in a cave for the past 15 years, the "Konami code" is:
Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A

From that point on, any additional key stroke will trigger additional objects or other related changes, depending on your choice
of easter eggs in the plugin's settings page. A choice of 'Random' will load one of 5 random scripts upon each load of a page.

== Installation ==

Very simple installation. So easy a unicorn could do it!

1. Create the directory `wp-cornify` under `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Upload `wp-cornify.php` and all .js files to your new `wp-cornify` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why won't the plugin work? =

Not sure! Try to check the following:

* View the web page's source and make sure the proper '.js' file is included
* Make sure jQuery is being loaded
* Make sure that your browser has focus when entering the "Konami code". Try just clicking in the web page first, in a non-input area
* Re-read the description OR contact your local video game geek and make sure you're not putting in the "Konami code" wrong
* Make sure you are using a browser that is compatible with [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com)
* As dumb as it sounds, make sure that the site in which the easter egg is being pulled from is not down or having other issues
